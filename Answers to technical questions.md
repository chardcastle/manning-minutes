> 1) How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

I spent a whole day. I needed a couple of hours to get up to date with PHP 8 and upgrading it on my machine. I lost some time thinking I could take a shortcut on model creation. I also had some issues with Mockery.
Whilst I'd only just drafted the classes and basic test driven development set up: my next step was going to be the minutes calculation. 

> 2) Why did you choose PHP as your main programming language?

Generally, I chose to learn PHP many years ago when the only other recommendation was Pearl. I believed this language had more mainstream appeal.
I correctly projected that PHP would become very popular and there'd be a vibrant community of developers using it. I now predict that Node.js will
have a similar journey and presence in the next generation of engineers.

I may have responded to this exercise with a node.js app instead because I've been using that more recently.

> 3) What is your favourite thing about your most familar PHP framework (Laravel / Symfony etc)?

Migrations make handling database schema changes very easy. They allow for changes to be applied and rolled back if there's an issue.
This fits well with continuous integration and deployment.

> 3) What is your least favourite thing about the above framework?

My least favourite thing about Laravel is a change they made to model creation. I believe it used to be possible to do this from a migration file.
This is no longer the case. For this exercise, the models had to be manually created.
